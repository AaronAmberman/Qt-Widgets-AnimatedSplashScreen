# Qt-Widgets-AnimatedSplashScreen
A simple animated splash screen for Qt Widgets.

The AnimatedSplashScreen is a simple animated splash screen for Qt Widgets. After finding a bunch of stuff online that kept saying to use QLabels and other jazz that just seemed overly complicated for just basically wanting to paint a series of images. Anyway came up with a suuuper simple implementation and want to share it with my future self and all those in the world who stumble upon this very simple animated splash screen for Qt Widgets. Enjoy! :)
